# Our Spots

Our Spots is an application where a group can collectively monitor and keep track of the restaurants you may want to frequent. When you sign up, you will have access to a collective list of restaurants added to by the community. You can then add the restaurants you want to your page and keep track of them.

This is the second project that I built during my time in the GA Web Development Immersive course (WDI Bowie for life!)

## Technologies Used
Javascript, Node.js, SQL, HTML and CSS were utilized in the creation of this project.

The following node.js packages were utilized:

- bcrypt
- body-parser
- connect-pg-simple
- dotenv
- ejs
- express
- express-session
- method-override
- morgan
- path
- pg

## If I Had More Time...

Then this site would also have the following:
- ability to bring up the details and contact info for a single restaurant
- to add new restaurants from the YELP API
- restaurant images, visuals and stylings would come from the YELP API
- ability to make user comments on restaurants
- ability to make reservations (open table API) and include other members of the site
- make it more DRY, more separation of concerns
